== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Example 1: 2 column layout using class only =
[column class="column1"]Column 1 content goes here.[/column]
[column class="column2"]Column 2 content goes here.[/column]
[end_columns]
Note: .column1 and .column2 must be defined in your theme's style.css

= Example 2: 3 column layout using css definitions =
[column width="200px" padding="10px"]Column 1 content goes here.[/column]
[column width="200px" padding="10px"]Column 2 content goes here.[/column]
[column width="200px" padding="10px"]Column 3 content goes here.[/column]
[end_columns]

= How does one remove the strange &lt;br/> and &lt;/p> tags that are being inserted between the columns =
This is due to WordPress processing the wonky wpautop function before processing shortcodes.  For a quick workaround, try the following:
  
1. Change execution priority of wpautop by adding the following line to function.php:  
add_filter( 'the_content', 'wpautop',20 );  
  
2. Remove breaks and spaces between the shortcodes, so the the columns appear all clumped together:  
[column class="column1"]Column 1 content goes here.[/column][column class="column2"]Column 2 content goes here.[/column][end_columns]
